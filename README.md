﻿# Houzeo-style Vue Real Estate UI

This repository contains a small Vue 3 + Vite app implementing a Houzeo-style property search UI (responsive listings, filters, and map layout).

Quick setup and run instructions

Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm (or yarn/pnpm)

Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

Run development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production
```bash
npm run build
```

Preview production build
```bash
npm run preview
```

Notes
- The app uses Vue 3 (Composition API) and Vite.
- The `src/components/FilterBar.vue` contains desktop and mobile styles. Desktop hides the small icon filter button and the mobile-only "Save Search" control. Mobile view restores them.
- A ZIP archive can be created from the project root (example path used by developer: `C:\Users\mayur\houzeo-app.zip`).

Troubleshooting
- If `npm run dev` fails, ensure Node.js is updated and that the terminal is opened in the project root.

If you want comments removed from other files too, I can do that next.
